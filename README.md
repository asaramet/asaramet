## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Saramet

I am an IT professional with a passion for networking, Linux, and cybersecurity. Currently, I am on a journey to explore more about networking and security.

### Experience

- Linux system administration
- Python, C, and a bit of Haskell programming
- Web programming with Angular
- Cisco and Aruba network administration

During my experience with Linux system administration, I have worked on various projects such as High Performance Cluster (HPC) system administration, automating deployment of web servers using Ansible and Docker, developing a wiki web page with Angular as frontend, and implementing security measures to protect against cyber attacks.

With Cisco and Aruba network administration, I have gained hands-on experience configuring and troubleshooting switches, routers, and wireless access points.
